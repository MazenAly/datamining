# About the project
This code is the python3 implementation of a nearest neighbor classifier for hand-written digit recognition. We also include a wrapper of Scikit Learn's k-neighbor classification for comparison and validation.

# Running
To try our version of nearest neighbor classifier, simply run:

```bash
python3 mnist_dataloader
```
To try the Scikit Learn version, run:

```bash
python3 mnist_dataloader scikit
```

# Result
The resulting confusion matrix and accuracy are stored in *exercise1-result.txt*.

The ground truths and predicted labels are stored in *label.txt* and *predicted.txt* respectively.
