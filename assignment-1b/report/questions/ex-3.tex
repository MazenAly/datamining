\section*{Exercise 3}
In this exercise, we show an example that the cosine distance does not follow the triangle inequality.

Let $p,q$ be 2 vectors where the angle $\alpha$ between them is $\frac{\pi}{2}$, and $r$ be the bisector of that angle. Thus, the angle $\beta$ between $p$ and $r$ and
the angle $\gamma$ between $r$ and $q$ are both $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We have:

\begin{align*}
  dist(p,q) &= 1 - cosine(\alpha) = 1 \\
  dist(p,r) + dist(r,q) &= 1 - cosine(\beta) + 1 - cosine(\gamma) \\
  &= 2 - \sqrt(2) < 1
\end{align*}

which means the cosine distance does not follow the triangle inequality in this case.

This completes the example.
