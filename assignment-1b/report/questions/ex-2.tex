\section*{Exercise 2}
In this excercise, we are proving that barycenter computed in the update step minimizes the cost function.

Let's first assume that $d = 1$. Then the cost function is 

$$\phi(U,b) = \Sigma_{p_i \in U} ||p_i - b||^2$$

The function is minimized when its derivative is 0. In this case, we are considering the changes of the function with respect to the way
we choose the center. Thus, we can take the partial derivative with respect to b.

\begin{align*}
  \frac{d}{d_b} \Sigma_{p_i \in U} ||p_i - b||^2 &= \Sigma_{p_i \in U} \frac{d}{d_b} ||p_i - b||^2 \\
  &= \Sigma_{p_i \in U} 2 \cdot ||p_i - b|| \cdot \frac{||p_i - b||}{p_i - b} \cdot (-1) \\
  &= 2 \Sigma_{p_i \in U} (b - p_i) \\
\end{align*}

The cost function is minimized when 

\begin{align*}
  2 \Sigma_{p_i \in U} (b - p_i) &= 0 \\
  \Sigma_{p_i \in U} b &= \Sigma_{p_i \in U} p_i \\
  b &= \frac{1}{n} \Sigma_{p_i in U} p_i \\
\end{align*}

where $n = |U|$.

The update step also assigns each point to the nearest center, which itself minimizes the total cost because the cost of each point is minimized.

When $d > 1$, the update step in each cluster is independent from the other clusters. Thus, the sum of the costs of each clusters is also minimized when each individual 
cost is minimized.

Therefore, the update step actually minimizes the cost function.
